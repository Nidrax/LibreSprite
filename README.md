## History
It all started with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org), developed by [David Capello](https://github.com/dacap).
Aseprite used to be distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2,
but was moved to a proprietary license on [August 26th, 2016](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/5ecc356a41c8e29977f8608d8826489d24f5fa6c).

Aa a response to that, [LibreSprite](https://github.com/LibreSprite/LibreSprite) was created as a fork of the last
GPLv2-licensed version of Aseprite, to continue its development as a free and open source project.
The work has been branched-out from the [last Aseprite commit](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/03be4aa23db465219962f4c62410f628e7392545) covered by the GPL version 2 license,
and is now developed independently of Aseprite.

In 2026 [Nidrax](https://github.com/Nidrax) forked the project under the [Veritaware](https://github.com/veritaware)
organization to create his own opinionated version of the editor independently of LibreSprite's team design decisions
and thus Besprited was born.
